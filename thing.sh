say "I am very upset with you guys.  I worked my ass off for both deals even
putting my job on the line by getting Scotia to do something they were not
supposed to do.  I worked most days of my vacation last week on this as well
and even spoke to you twice and you said nothing! I told you up front there
would be an insurance fee as you Matt do not show enough income.

I have lost countless hours on these deals which costs me money and as you
know I work 100% on commission not like the person you went to at Meridian
(I am assuming)." -o ~/Desktop/recording.aiff
